A working Weather App.
Created as practice using and displaying API information. 
Overall goal of the project is to practice TailwindCSS, JavaScript and APIs in a working weather app.  
Tailwind used as main styling tool.
Still under development with further ideas to be implemented.

If I was to start this project again, I would use a library such as React for faster, more efficient loading.
